# Installing your dev environment.

This documentation is intended to help you to install your environment in the following cases:
* You want to contribute to App Search Magento module as a developer.
* You need a full featured Magento environment with App Search enabled for testing / QA purpose.

## Requirements:

### Docker:

The development environment is dockerized, you will need Docker to be installed on your dev environment.

### Magento Developer Account:

In order to download Magento, an account it is required to have an account on Magento. If you do not have one already, you can create it at: https://account.magento.com/customer/account/create/

Once your account is created AND VALIDATED (check your mail inbox to get the validation link), you should be able to access your credentials management page at the following address: https://marketplace.magento.com/customer/accessKeys/

Create an new access key and note both public and private key (you will need it while building the Magento docker container later).

### App Search Account:

You will need an App Search account. If you do not have one already, you can create it at: https://app.swiftype.com/signup

Once logged, you can find your App Search credentials at: https://app.swiftype.com/as/credentials

To install the dev environment you will need to configure both the API Endpoint and a Private API key.

## Stack content:

The stack contains:
* Preconfigured component to store data (MySQL and Redis)
* A custom Apache PHP image containing all the Magento code (+ sample catalog data)

## Building the stack:

Before being able to use the stack you will need to build the custom image:

```bash
docker-compose build --build-arg public_key="<public_key>" --build-arg private_key="<private_key>"
```

**Note :**
* Replace both `<public_key>` and `<private_key` by your credentials created in your Magento account
* Additional build args can be used to change the Magento version or to disable sample data install

Because, there is a lot of dependencies to install the first run may takes several minutes. Consecutive run will be faster.

## Configure App Search

Your App Search credential are stored into the `dev/magento.env` file.
You should replace them before launching the stack.

**Note:** Every time you change something in the `dev/magento.env` file, the containers will be recreated if running `docker-compose up` and you will need to reinstall Magento.

## Running the stack

You can launch the stack by running:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
````

To invoke a bash session into the Magento container, you should use:

```bash
docker-compose exec magento sudo -u www-data -E /bin/bash
```

**Note:** We are using the `www-data` user in order to preserve access rights when using Magento command. You should never use another account.

## Installing App Search module:

Before installing Magento, you have to deploy the App Search module by using the following command (into the container).

```bash
composer require "swiftype/swiftype-app-search-magento"
```

**Note:** The App Search module will be symlinked from your host machine. So any change you will do will be replicated in your Magento instance.

## Installing Magento:

To install your Magento instance, you have to login in the container and use:

```bash
bin/magento setup:install
```

The MySQL/Redis databases come preconfigured with the devbox, so you do not need to worry about it.

Once the setup is finished, you should be able to access to Magento from your browser at http://localhost:8888 (http://localhost:8888/admin for the admin).

To create an admin account, use the following command:

```bash
bin/magento admin:user:create
```

You can check the App Search extension is correctly installed and configured by connecting to the admin:
1. Go into `Store --> Configuration`.
2. You should be able to find a `Ãˆlastic App Search` tab into the General section
3. Click on it and see if your API Endpoint is correctly configured (should be disabled for edit if using env variable).
